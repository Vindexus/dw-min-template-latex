## Minimal Playbook Template for Dungeon World, LaTeX version

*Licensed under CC-BY 4.0, as the original template and the original content.*

Modeled on Yochai Gal's excellent [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t27w3OxpWP9IXSO0Y6o7tal1oRJ5-1THPj1UMvQ28xc/edit) version.

The resulting playbook is a fillable pdf.

* You need LaTeX installed (with xelatex) to use this. You will also need at least a basic understanding of LaTeX.

* Some elements use absolute positioning, mostly the textfields and overlays. So if you add lines in a column above one of these positioned elements, it'll be wonky until you also adjust the positioning. This is kind of a PITA but should really only be an issue when adding gear.

  HOW: Search for "textblock". Textblock positioning is in the form (X, Y); try moving the Y up or down by .5 at a time until it looks right.

* Fonts expected are Istok Web and Alegreya Sans SC, both available on Google Fonts. You can sub in your own fonts, but watch for spacing changes.
